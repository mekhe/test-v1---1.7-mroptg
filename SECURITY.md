# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the AI-Driven Application Intake Platform, please follow these steps to report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by the security team.
2. Encrypt your vulnerability report using our [PGP key](security-pgp-public-key.asc).
3. Send the encrypted report to [security@dollarfunding.com](mailto:security@dollarfunding.com) with the following information:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested remediation steps
4. You will receive an automated acknowledgment with a tracking ID within 1 hour.
5. Our security team will respond within 24 hours with an initial assessment.

## Security Measures

### Data Encryption
- All data at rest is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Data in transit is protected using TLS 1.3
- Field-level encryption for sensitive financial data and PII
- Encryption key rotation every 30 days

### Network Security
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
- DDoS mitigation through Azure Front Door
- Network segmentation with strict pod security policies
- Service mesh with mutual TLS authentication
- IP whitelisting and CIDR-based access controls

### Container Security
- Read-only root filesystem enforcement
- Non-root user container execution
- Privileged container prohibition
- Resource quota enforcement
- Regular security scanning of container images
- Mandatory pod security policies

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
- Multi-factor authentication requirement
- Just-in-time access provisioning
- Regular access reviews
- Principle of least privilege enforcement

### Monitoring and Detection
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)
- Audit logging of all security events
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR Compliance

## Incident Response

### Response Procedures
1. Immediate containment of the threat
2. Impact assessment and classification
3. Evidence collection and preservation
4. Root cause analysis
5. Remediation implementation
6. Post-incident review

### Communication Protocol
