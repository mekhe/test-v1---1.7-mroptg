## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 LTS (with latest security patches)
- Python 3.11 (with security updates)
- Docker v24 (with security best practices)
- Git 2.x

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dollarfunding/ai-intake-platform.git
cd ai-intake-platform
```

2. Install security tools and dependencies:
```bash
npm install -g @commitlint/cli@17.x husky@8.x
npm install
```

3. Configure Git hooks for security scanning:
```bash
npx husky install
```

## Security Standards

### Code Security Requirements
- Follow OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines
- Implement input validation for all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Apply principle of least privilege
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Secret Management
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive configuration
- Use Azure Key Vault for secret storage
- Implement secret rotation mechanisms
- Use environment variables for local development

### Secure Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches
- Run regular vulnerability scans
- Use only approved npm registries
- Lock dependency versions

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
